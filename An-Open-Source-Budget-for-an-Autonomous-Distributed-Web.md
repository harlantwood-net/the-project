An Open Source Budget for an Autonomous Distributed Web
=======================================================

This budget is designed to answer the question, "If you had up to 100 million dollars that you wanted to donate to creating an autonomous, distributed web, as the logical next step after today's proprietary data silos, how would you divide it?"

What if there was plenty of money?  There are many philanthropists searching for exactly how to make the largest global impact possible with their finite but abundant gifts.

While there is no shortage of resources, what does seem to be lacking is a coherent, inspiring story of how the next-generation infrastructure (social and technical) projects could combine to create a meaningful shift, a decentralized, autonomous hub for human creativity.  This document is one step toward creating that story.

This document is created intentionally as a _straw man_ -- though necessarily incomplete and surely flawed, it is intended to at stimulate debate and further ideas.  If you wish to contribute, please [fork this proposal](http://prose.io/#harlantwood-net/the-project/edit/master/An-Open-Source-Budget-for-an-Autonomous-Distributed-Web.md), changing it in any way you see fit to create a better version.
